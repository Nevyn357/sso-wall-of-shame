# sso-wall-of-shame

This is a fork of the original but now unmaintained [robchahin/sso-wall-of-shame](https://github.com/robchahin/sso-wall-of-shame) which was published at https://sso.tax. The growing backlog of requests in that repository was a clear indicator that the good work started by Rob is still needed. While we would've preferred to work with Rob on his existing effort and [help shoulder the load](https://github.com/robchahin/sso-wall-of-shame/issues/163), it would seem that life has pulled him in other directions enough that he wasn't able to respond to us. Hopefully, at some point in the future our efforts can be merged again.

A list of vendors that treat single sign-on as a luxury feature, not a core security requirement.

Page structure lives in index.md, including intro text and FAQs for now.

List of vendors is in _data/vendors.yml.
